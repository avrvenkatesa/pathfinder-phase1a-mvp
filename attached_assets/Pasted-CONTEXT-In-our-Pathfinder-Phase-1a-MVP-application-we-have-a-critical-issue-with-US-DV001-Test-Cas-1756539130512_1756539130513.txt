CONTEXT: In our Pathfinder Phase 1a MVP application, we have a critical issue with US-DV001 Test Case 1 Step 5. When a contact
  is deleted or modified in one browser tab, the workflow in another tab doesn't receive real-time validation updates. The
  deleted contact still appears as valid in the workflow with no warnings.

  ISSUE:
  - Contact deletions/modifications are not propagated to workflows in real-time
  - No validation warnings appear when assigned contacts become invalid
  - WebSocket or event-driven validation appears to be non-functional

  FILES TO CHECK/MODIFY:
  1. client/src/services/contact-websocket.service.ts - WebSocket connection
  2. client/src/components/workflow-contact-assignment.tsx - Workflow assignment component
  3. server/controllers/contacts.ts - Contact deletion endpoint
  4. server/controllers/workflow.ts - Workflow validation logic

  FIX REQUIREMENTS:

  1. Implement WebSocket Event Broadcasting when a contact is deleted/modified:
  // In contact deletion endpoint
  io.emit('contact:deleted', { contactId, timestamp });
  io.emit('contact:modified', { contactId, changes, timestamp });

  2. Add WebSocket Listeners in the workflow component:
  // Listen for contact changes
  socket.on('contact:deleted', (data) => {
    // Check if deleted contact is assigned to current workflow
    // Show validation warning
    // Update workflow state
  });

  3. Create Validation Warning Component:
  // Show real-time validation alerts
  if (deletedContactIds.includes(assignedContactId)) {
    return <Alert type="error">Assigned contact has been deleted. Please reassign.</Alert>
  }

  4. Add Referential Integrity Check:
  // Before workflow save/update
  const validateContactAssignments = async (workflowId, contactIds) => {
    const activeContacts = await checkContactsExist(contactIds);
    return activeContacts.filter(c => c.isActive && !c.deleted);
  };

  5. Implement Periodic Validation Refresh:
  // Fallback polling mechanism if WebSocket fails
  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      validateAssignedContacts();
    }, 30000); // Check every 30 seconds
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  TESTING THE FIX:
  1. Open workflow in Tab A
  2. Assign a contact to the workflow
  3. Open contacts in Tab B
  4. Delete the assigned contact in Tab B
  5. Tab A should immediately show a validation warning
  6. The workflow should prevent saving with invalid contact

  EXPECTED OUTCOME:
  - Real-time validation warnings appear within 1-2 seconds
  - Clear error message: "Assigned contact [Name] has been deleted"
  - Workflow cannot be saved until invalid assignment is resolved
  - Visual indicator (red border/highlight) on invalid assignments

  Please implement this fix focusing on establishing proper WebSocket communication between contact and workflow services for
  real-time validation updates.
