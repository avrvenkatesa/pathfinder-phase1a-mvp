Fix the drag-and-drop validation logic that's preventing valid department transfers. Currently getting "Invalid Move: Relationship is not allowed" when trying to move Sara Mitchell from Editorial Services to Design and Production.

ISSUES TO ADDRESS:

1. OVERLY RESTRICTIVE VALIDATION:
   - Allow department transfers for regular employees (non-supervisors)
   - Only restrict moves that would create circular reporting relationships
   - Allow cross-department moves unless they violate direct reporting chains

2. VALIDATION RULES TO IMPLEMENT:
   ALLOW:
   - Moving employees between departments (if no direct reports in old department)
   - Moving people within same company across divisions
   - Updating department affiliation while preserving reporting relationships
   
   PREVENT:
   - Circular reporting relationships (A reports to B, B reports to A)
   - Moving supervisors who have direct reports (suggest bulk move instead)
   - Cross-company moves without explicit permission

3. IMPROVED USER FEEDBACK:
   - Replace generic "Invalid Move" with specific reason:
     * "Cannot move: Contact has direct reports in current department"
     * "Cannot move: Would create circular reporting relationship"
     * "Cannot move: Cross-company transfers require admin approval"
   - Provide suggested solutions in error messages
   - Show preview of relationship changes before confirming move

4. ENHANCED MOVE FUNCTIONALITY:
   - Add "Move with Team" option for supervisors
   - Add confirmation dialog showing relationship impacts
   - Allow temporary moves (project assignments) vs permanent transfers
   - Provide bulk move options for entire teams

5. TESTING SCENARIOS TO ENSURE WORK:
   - Move regular employee between departments ✓
   - Move supervisor with option to move team ✓
   - Prevent circular relationships ✓
   - Show clear error messages for invalid moves ✓

Please fix the validation logic to be more permissive for valid business cases while maintaining data integrity. Focus on making department transfers work smoothly for typical organizational changes.
