  - Search and filtering capabilities
  - Integration with existing contact management system

6. Workflow Execution Engine
- WorkflowExecutionMonitor: Real-time execution monitoring with:
  - Sequential workflow execution
  - Task state management (Pending, In Progress, Completed, etc.)
  - Automatic progression between tasks
  - Decision gateway logic evaluation
  - Real-time status dashboard
  - Execution history tracking
  - Pause/Resume/Stop functionality

7. Workflow Management Dashboard
- WorkflowDashboard: Complete management interface with:
  - Workflow listing with search and filters
  - Instance monitoring and tracking
  - Template library and management
  - Analytics and reporting dashboard
  - Bulk operations support

8. UI Integration
- WorkflowPage: Integrated workflow editor with tabs for:
  - Designer (drag-and-drop editor)
  - Assignments (contact assignment interface)
  - Execution (real-time monitoring)
  - Preview (workflow overview and BPMN export)
- Updated navigation header with workflow links
- Seamless integration with existing Material-UI design system

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Delivered

- Drag-and-Drop Designer: Visual BPMN 2.0 workflow creation
- Contact Integration: Smart assignment based on skills and availability
- Real-time Execution: Live workflow monitoring and control
- BPMN 2.0 Export: Standards-compliant XML export
- Template System: Reusable workflow templates
- Validation Engine: Real-time error detection and warnings
- Mobile Responsive: Works on all device sizes
- Auto-save: Prevents data loss during design

ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

- Built on existing Express.js + React + TypeScript + PostgreSQL stack
- Uses existing authentication and authorization system
- Integrates seamlessly with current contact management APIs
- Maintains consistent Material-UI design system
- Real-time updates using proper state management
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

The workflow designer is now fully functional and ready for use. Users can access it through the
"Workflows" link in the navigation header, create new workflows with the drag-and-drop designer, assign
 contacts to tasks, execute workflows, and monitor their progress in real-time.
