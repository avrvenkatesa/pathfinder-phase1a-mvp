# US-DV001 Cross-System Data Validation Framework - Acceptance Tests

## Test Overview
This document tracks the acceptance testing of the US-DV001 Cross-System Data Validation Framework. Tests are conducted systematically, one at a time, with user feedback collected for each test.

**Testing Date**: January 7, 2025  
**Implementation Status**: COMPLETED - Full validation framework operational
**Authentication Status**: WORKING - OAuth system properly restored

---

### Test 1: Real-Time Contact Form Validation

**Test Description**: Verify that real-time validation works in contact creation forms

**Expected Results**:
- Navigate to contact creation form after authentication
- Enter invalid email format (e.g., "invalid-email") - should show error immediately
- Leave required fields empty - should show validation warnings
- Enter valid data - should show success indicators
- All validation feedback should appear in real-time without form submission

**Test Result**: âœ… PASSED - Real-time validation system fully operational

**Notes**: 
- Authentication system working perfectly with Google/Microsoft OAuth logos
- Enhanced contact form includes comprehensive real-time validation
- ValidationFeedback component displays errors, warnings, and success states
- Validation service integrates with API Gateway proxy routing
- Real-time validation triggers on field changes with debounced API calls
- Email uniqueness validation, hierarchy integrity checks, and required field validation all working

### Test 2: Data Quality Dashboard Access

**Test Description**: Navigate to and verify the data quality dashboard functionality

**Test Route**: `/data-quality`

**Expected Results**:
- Dashboard should be accessible to authenticated users
- Display validation metrics, success rates, and failure analysis
- Show charts and graphs for data quality trends
- Provide filtering by entity type and time range
- Display recent validation failures with details

**Actual Results**: [TO BE FILLED]

**Test Result**: [TO BE FILLED]

**Notes**: [TO BE FILLED]

### Test 3: Cross-System Validation Rules

**Test Description**: Test validation rules that span multiple system domains

**Expected Results**:
- Contact assignment capacity validation should work across workflow and contact systems
- Timeline conflict detection should identify scheduling conflicts
- Cross-reference validation should maintain data integrity between systems
- Bulk validation should process multiple entities efficiently

**Actual Results**: [TO BE FILLED]

**Test Result**: [TO BE FILLED]

**Notes**: [TO BE FILLED]

### Test 4: Validation API Integration

**Test Description**: Verify API Gateway proxy routing and microservice communication

**Expected Results**:
- `/api/validation/*` endpoints should be accessible through API Gateway
- Authentication middleware should protect validation endpoints
- Service-to-service communication should work reliably
- Error handling should provide meaningful feedback

**Actual Results**: [TO BE FILLED]

**Test Result**: [TO BE FILLED]

**Notes**: [TO BE FILLED]

---

### Test 5: Monitoring and Alerts

**Test Description**: Test the validation monitoring and alerting system

**Expected Results**:
- ValidationMonitor should track performance metrics
- Automated alerts should trigger for validation failures exceeding thresholds
- Daily/weekly reports should be generated automatically
- Performance data should be available in the dashboard

**Actual Results**: [TO BE FILLED]

**Test Result**: [TO BE FILLED]

**Notes**: [TO BE FILLED]
